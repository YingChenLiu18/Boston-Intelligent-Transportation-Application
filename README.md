My application is called Boston Intelligent Transportation Application. I designed it to make public transportation easier for anyone living in or traveling to Boston.

Each user can easily register for an account and get an e-transit card. Then the user can recharge(money or Day Pass) and use the e-transit card. 

This application also has many additional functions, such as ride history, recharge history, etc.
